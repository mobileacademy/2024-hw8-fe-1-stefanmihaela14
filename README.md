# Homework (HTML, CSS, JS)

Generate a board for the popular Minesweeper Game. Create a set of functions accordingly.

* make sure to have at least three difficulties for the game
* hold the current state of the board
* you may use the structure described in solution-template.js to keep the state and apply logic or you can write everything from scratch
* you have complete freedom for HTML & CSS and how the GUI looks like, just keep it simple for the user to understand the game interface
* allow the user to edit bombProbability and maxProbability with the help of inputs. Note that the fields will also reflect the current values
* allow the user to select the difficulty of the game with the help of a dropdown, this will change the board size and bombProbability
* deploy the app on a hosting service (ex: Firebase) and provide the URL in a text file added in the src folder, called src/hosting.txt

### Other mentions
